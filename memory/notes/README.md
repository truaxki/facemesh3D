# Memory Notes Section

**Type**: Documentation Organization  
**Context**: Notes and reports for specific topics  
**Tags**: notes, reports, documentation  
**Created**: 2025-01-28

## Purpose

This section contains focused notes, reports, and documentation on specific aspects of the facial microexpression analysis system. Unlike the broader memory system, these notes are designed for:

- **Technical reports** on specific methodologies
- **Implementation notes** for complex features
- **Research documentation** for scientific approaches
- **Analysis summaries** for system behavior

## Organization

### Current Notes
- `baseline_definition_report.md` - Technical report on baseline calculation methodologies

### Future Notes Structure

## Note Types

### Technical Reports
- Methodology explanations
- Algorithm implementations
- Mathematical foundations
- Validation results

### Implementation Notes
- Feature development details
- Code architecture decisions
- Integration challenges
- Solution approaches

### Analysis Summaries
- System behavior analysis
- Performance evaluations
- User interaction patterns
- Quality assessments

## Guidelines for New Notes

1. **Clear Purpose**: Each note should address a specific topic or question
2. **Active Voice**: Use direct, action-oriented language
3. **Technical Accuracy**: Include code examples and precise descriptions
4. **Practical Focus**: Emphasize how concepts apply to the system
5. **Future-Oriented**: Consider implications for system development

## Integration with Memory System

Notes complement the broader memory system by providing:
- **Deep dives** into specific topics covered broadly elsewhere
- **Technical details** that support high-level documentation
- **Research backing** for implementation decisions
- **Reference material** for future development

## Maintenance

- Update notes when underlying implementations change
- Cross-reference with related memory components
- Archive outdated notes with clear deprecation notices
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure
