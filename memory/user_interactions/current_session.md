## Key Interaction Patterns

### 1. **Interface Improvement Requests**
**Pattern**: User identifies specific UI problems → Requests targeted improvements → Provides feedback on results

**Examples**:
- "Cluttered interface with unused Open3D sidebar" → Sidebar redesign
- "All settings in the red need to be on the side bar" → Complete control consolidation
- "We need a very notable loading bar" → Prominent progress implementation

### 2. **Memory System Request**
**Pattern**: User requests comprehensive documentation system → Wants organized knowledge management

**Specific Request**:
> "search the web for agentic memory best practices. then start saving information in markdown files here to better organize agentic understanding of this codebase @memory"

**Intent**: Establish persistent knowledge system for future AI agent interactions

### 3. **Environment Modernization**
**Pattern**: User adopts modern development tools → Requests documentation updates

**Recent Request (2025-01-27)**:
> "lets build this with uv" → "Plese update memory with the fact that we are now using UV for envireoment management"

**Intent**: Migrate to faster, more reliable dependency management
