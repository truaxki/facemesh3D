# Current Session Interaction Log

**Type**: Episodic + Working Memory
**Context**: Active user session with facemesh codebase
**Tags**: user-preferences, session-context, interaction-patterns
**Related**: [[components-streamlit-interface]], [[issues-ui-redesign-history]]

## Session Overview

### Session Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-01-24
- **Duration**: Extended session (multiple interactions)
- **Context**: Agentic memory system implementation request
- **Platform**: Windows 10 (10.0.26100)
- **Shell**: PowerShell
- **Working Directory**: `C:\Users\ktrua\source\facemesh`

## User Profile and Preferences

### Demonstrated Preferences
1. **UI Design**: Strongly prefers sidebar-based layouts with clear separation
2. **Progress Feedback**: Values prominent, visible progress indicators
3. **Simplicity**: Wants clean interfaces without unnecessary clutter
4. **Functionality**: Prioritizes working features over aesthetic elements

### Communication Style
- **Direct**: Provides clear, specific feedback about interface issues
- **Visual**: Uses screenshots to communicate layout preferences
- **Iterative**: Willing to go through multiple redesign cycles

## Key Interaction Patterns

### 1. **Interface Improvement Requests**
**Pattern**: User identifies specific UI problems → Requests targeted improvements → Provides feedback on results

**Examples**:
- "Cluttered interface with unused Open3D sidebar" → Sidebar redesign
- "All settings in the red need to be on the side bar" → Complete control consolidation
- "We need a very notable loading bar" → Prominent progress implementation

### 2. **Memory System Request**
**Pattern**: User requests comprehensive documentation system → Wants organized knowledge management

**Specific Request**:
> "search the web for agentic memory best practices. then start saving information in markdown files here to better organize agentic understanding of this codebase @memory"

**Intent**: Establish persistent knowledge system for future AI agent interactions

## Technical Context Awareness
