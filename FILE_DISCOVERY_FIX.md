# Feature File Discovery Fix

## 🔍 Issue
The Model Training tab wasn't finding feature files after extraction because the file list was cached in the session state.

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Cache Clearing**
After feature extraction completes, the cached file list is now automatically cleared:
```python
# In streamlit_interface.py - after saving extracted features
if 'available_files_info' in st.session_state:
    del st.session_state['available_files_info']
```

### 2. **Manual Refresh Button**
Added a "🔄 Refresh Files" button in the Model Training tab:
- Located in the top-right corner
- Clears cached file info and refreshes the page
- Use this if files still don't appear

### 3. **Tab Switching Refresh**
The File Overview tab now always refreshes when viewed, ensuring the latest files are shown.

## 📁 File Structure Verification

Your feature files are correctly saved in:
```
data/write/
├── e3/
│   └── extracted_features_20250531_130051.csv [displacement]
├── e4/
│   └── extracted_features_20250531_123034.csv [displacement, quaternion]
└── e6/
    └── extracted_features_20250531_130357.csv [displacement, quaternion]
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### If Files Don't Appear:

1. **Method 1: Refresh Button**
   - Go to Model Training tab
   - Click "🔄 Refresh Files" button in top-right
   - Files should now appear

2. **Method 2: Tab Switch**
   - Go to File Overview tab
   - Then back to Model Training tab
   - This forces a refresh

3. **Method 3: After Extraction**
   - Files should automatically appear after feature extraction
   - Look for the message: "💡 **Next Steps:** Go to Model Training tab..."

## 🧪 Testing

Run these scripts to verify:
```bash
# Check file paths and discovery
python debug_file_paths.py

# Test file discovery logic
python test_file_discovery.py

# Run model training demo
python demo_random_forest.py
```

## 📊 Current Status

You have **3 feature files** ready for model training:
- Total samples across all files should be sufficient for training
- Files contain both displacement and quaternion features
- Ready to train Random Forest models

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Always extract features first** before trying to train models
2. **Use the refresh button** if you've added new files
3. **Check File Overview tab** to see all available files
4. **Feature files** are named `extracted_features_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
